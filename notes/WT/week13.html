<h1>WT Week 13 </h1>

<h1>Cellular Network Technology I</h1>

<p><strong>tldr</strong> - The cellular concept, the architecture of the GSM networks, the GSM network layer, and GSM radio link/interface</p>

<h2>Cell Phones</h2>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Cellphone network uses cell towers (antenna) via a switching office to communicate via radio waves</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Transmission</h4>

<ul>
	<li>For transmission using radio waves, a frequency channel is used</li>
	<li>As a cell phone is a duplex device, it can transmit and receive at the same time. Hence 2 channels are required for each phone</li>
	<li>Disadvantage of having 1 cell tower in a whole city

		<ul>
			<li>Not enough channels to support many users</li>
			<li>Each cell phone must have a powerful transmitter and receiver in order to reach the cell tower (more power consumption)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Cell Concept</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>To overcome the limitation of 1 large central antenna, cell concept is used</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>A geographical area is divided into small areas called cells</li>
	<li>Cells can be sized at about 2 x 2 square miles</li>
	<li>Cells are shown as hexagons on a hexagonal grid</li>
</ul>

<h4>Low Power Transmitter </h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Each cell has a base station that consists of an antenna tower and a small building containing the radio equipment. The base station uses a low power transmitter</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Low power transmitter has 2 advantages:

		<ol>
			<li>Battery Life

				<ul>
					<li>Reduces power consumption of a cell phone, which is normally battery operated. Low power means small batteries.</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Frequency Re-use

				<ul>
					<li>Transmissions between a base station and phones with its cell do not make it very far outside the cell. Non-adjacent cells can use the same set of frequencies without interference, and can be reuse across a big area. This reduces the number of frequencies to support all users.</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>Base Station</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>A base station manages, sends, and receives traffic from mobile phones within the geographical area to a distant cellular telephone switch called a Mobile Telecommunications Switching Office (MTSO)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>MTSO

		<ul>
			<li>Authenticates wireless customers before establishing connection</li>
			<li>Places calls from land-based telephones to wireless customers</li>
			<li>Switches calls between cells as mobile travel across cell boundaries </li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Cellular Phone Technologies</h3>

<p>Widely used cellular technologies are:</p>

<h4>CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)</h4>

<h4>TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Analog and inefficient. Also obsolete</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Adopted by Singapore</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>GSM Network Architecture</h3>

<figure><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zeuZM2x.png" alt="GSM Network Architecture"/><figcaption>GSM Network Architecture</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Mobile Station</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Mobile Equipment (ME)

		<ul>
			<li>Identified internally by IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity), which is allocated by equipment manufacturer</li>
			<li>IMEI is registered into Equipment Identity Register (EIR) by the network operator (telco)</li>
			<li>Example: Handphones</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)

		<ul>
			<li>Contains IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) that identifies a user on a network.</li>
			<li>IMSI contains Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC) and Mobile Subscriber Identity Number (MSIN)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Base Station Subsystem</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Base Transceiver Station (BTS) or Base Station

		<ul>
			<li>Helps define a cell’s boundary, and responsible for the radio link protocol with the Mobile Station</li>
			<li>Transmit and receives signal to/from mobile users using different frequencies</li>
			<li>Found on elevated location such as towers, poles, water tanks or roof-tops</li>
			<li>Has a frequency band that provides multiple channels</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Base Station Controller (BSC)

		<ul>
			<li>Controls multiple BTSs</li>
			<li>Manages radio channel setups and hangovers</li>
			<li>BSC connects the Mobile Station and the Mobile Switching Centre (MSC)</li>
		</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Network Switching Subsystem</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Mobile Switching Centre

		<blockquote>
		<p>Also known as Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO)</p>
		</blockquote>

		<ul>
			<li>Handles a few BSCs</li>
			<li>Manages location of mobiles</li>
			<li>Manages setup of calls to/from mobile station</li>
			<li>Manages security</li>
			<li>Collects call billing data and sends to billing system</li>
			<li>Collects traffic statistics for performance monitoring</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Home Location Register (HLR)

		<blockquote>
		<p>Stores location about each subscriber that belongs to the MSC</p>
		</blockquote></li>
	<li>Visitor Location Register (VLR)

		<blockquote>
		<p>Maintains information about subscribers currently physically in the region</p>
		</blockquote></li>
	<li>Authentication Centre (AuC)

		<blockquote>
		<p>Databases used for handling authentication and encryption keys</p>
		</blockquote></li>
	<li>Equipment Identity Register (EIR)

		<blockquote>
		<p>A list of all valid mobile equipments (ME) on the network by keeping all valid IMEI in used</p>
		</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<h3>GSM Signalling Protocols</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>GSM components talk to each other using signal-based protocols</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Signalling Protocols involve 3 layers

		<ul>
			<li>Layer 1: Physical Layer</li>
			<li>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</li>
			<li>Layer 3: Network Layer</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The Network Layer (Layer 3) is divided into 3 functionalities:</p>

<h4>Radio Resource Management (RRM)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Manage call control, supplementary service and short message services (SMS). E.g. establishes incoming call connection</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Involves 3 functional components

		<ol>
			<li>Mobile Station (MS)</li>
			<li>Base Station Subsystem (BSS)</li>
			<li>Mobile Switching Centre (MSC)</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>A major aspect of RRM is handover or handoff

		<blockquote>
		<p>The switching of an ongoing call to a different channel or cell</p>
		</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Types of handover:</p>

<h5>Internal handover (handled by BSC)</h5>

<p><strong>Intra-cell handover</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transferring call connection to another channel on the same BTS</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img src="http://i.imgur.com/FQ90aCh.png" alt="Intra-cell Handover"/><figcaption>Intra-cell Handover</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Intern inter-cell handover</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transferring call connection to another BTS on the same BSC</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ou8AIeB.png" alt="Intern Inter-cell Handover"/><figcaption>Intern Inter-cell Handover</figcaption></figure>

<h5>External handover (handled by MSC)</h5>

<p><strong>MSC intern handover</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transferring call connection between BTSs of different BSCs on the same MSC<br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mF0pbEX.png" alt="MSC Intern Handover"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>MSC extern handover</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transferring call connection to another BTS under the control of different MSC<br/><img src="http://i.imgur.com/H4SZM23.png" alt="MSC Extern Handover"/></p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Mobility Management (MM)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Handles the following issues

		<ul>
			<li>Location Management and other mobility issues</li>
			<li>Authentication and other security issues</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Main function is to facilitate location updating

		<blockquote>
		<p>When there is an incoming call for a mobile station (MS1), the network needs to be aware of the location of MS1 so as to transfer the call to the proper cell</p>
		</blockquote></li>
	<li>Location updating involve 3 components

		<ol>
			<li>Home Location Register (HLR)</li>
			<li>Visitor Location Register (VLR)</li>
			<li>Mobile Switching Centre (MSC)</li>
		</ol></li>
</ul>

<h5>How MM works:</h5>

<ol>
	<li>In GSM, cells are group into location areas (LA)</li>
	<li>When a Mobile Station (MS) crosses from one LA to another, it sends location updating messages to the MSC and VLR of the new LA</li>
	<li>The new VR records the location information of the MS</li>
	<li>Location Information is sent to the HLR from the new VLR</li>
	<li>The HLR sends a subset of the subscriber’s information to the new VLR required for call control</li>
	<li>The HLR informs the previous MSC/VLR to cancel registration of the MS</li>
</ol>

<h4>Connection Management (CM) - Optional</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Overseas link between mobile and MSC. E.g. manages handovers</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Radio Link/ Air Interface</h3>

<ul>
	<li>2 Frequency Bands are used:

		<ol>
			<li>Uplink Transmission (MS to BS)</li>
			<li>Downlink Transmission (BS to MS)</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In GSM-900, a frequency band of 25MHz are allocated to each links

		<ol>
			<li>Uplink (890 - 915 MHz)</li>
			<li>Downlink (935 - 960 MHz)</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>GSM uses a combination of FDMA and TDMA</li>
	<li>Each 25MHz bands are divided into 124 frequency sub-bands (124 channels) using <em>FDMA</em></li>
	<li>Each channels is allocated a 200kHz carrier spacing</li>
	<li>The 2 frequency bands give a total of 248 channels (2 * 124)</li>
	<li>248 channels, combined with an 8-slot <em>TDMA</em> scheme, gives a total of 1984 logical channels</li>
	<li>If there is a cluster of 7 cells sharing the logical channels, each cells in the cluster would use 283 channels</li>
</ul>
