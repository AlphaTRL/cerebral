<h3>HSPA (3.5G)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>High-Speed Packet Access</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>HSDPA (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access)</h4>

<ul>
	<li>3GPP Release 5 introduces HSDPA that allows UMTS-networks to provide higher downlink data transfer rates on smartphones</li>
	<li>May deliver up to 14.4Mbps download speed</li>
</ul>

<h5>Key Benefits</h5>

<ul>
	<li>High data transfer rates</li>
	<li>Lower Latency

		<ul>
			<li>Useful for time-sensitive applications such as interactive and streaming multimedia </li>
			<li>Application such as database transactions</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Better modulation techniques</li>
	<li>Retransmission from Base Station</li>
	<li>Scheduling done at Base Staton</li>
</ul>

<h4>HSUPA (High-Speed Uplink Packet Access)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>aka Enhanced Uplink (EUL)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Max uplink transfer rate is upgraded from 2Mbps to 5.76Mbps with Release 6 in HSUPA for smartphones like the iPhone 4</li>
	<li>HSDPA and HSUPA are collectively called <strong>HSPA</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>HSPA+ (Evolved HSPA)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Wireless broadband standard defined in 3GPP Release 7</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Uses MIMO technologies and higher-order modulation (64-QAM)</li>
	<li>Bandwidth:

		<ul>
			<li>Downlink - up to 56Mbps</li>
			<li>Uplink - up to 22Mbos</li>
			<li>Future bandwidth of 168Mbps may be possible using multiple carriers</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>LTE (4G)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Long Term Evolution</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Bandwidth:

		<ul>
			<li>Downlink - up to 150Mbps</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<h5>Air Interfaces</h5>

<ul>
	<li>2 different types of air interface (radio links)

		<ul>
			<li>One for Downlink

				<ul>
					<li>One for Uplink</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Cell tower uses multiplexing technique that requires a power transmitter</li>
			<li>LTE devices do not have a strong and powerful signal going back to the cell tower, to conserve battery life </li>
			<li>LTE devices use a different multiplexing scheme that does not require a powerful transmitter</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>Multiplexing Technique</h5>

<ul>
	<li>LTE uses OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access)

		<ul>
			<li>The OFDM signal used in LTE comprises a maximum of 2048 different sub-carriers with a spacing of 15kHz</li>
			<li>Within the OFDM signal, it possible to choose 3 different types of modulation, depending on the quality of the signal

				<ul>
					<li>QPSK</li>
					<li>16-QAM</li>
					<li>64-QAM</li>
				</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5>Multiple-input and Multiple-output Antenna (MIMO)</h5>

<ul>
	<li>MIMO devices have multiple input and output antennas

		<ul>
			<li>These devices have multiple connection to a single cell

				<ul>
					<li>Increase stability of the connection</li>
					<li>Reduces latency tremendously</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>Increase total throughput of a connection</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>LTE+ (4G+)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>LTE-Advanced</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Bandwidth:

		<ul>
			<li>Downlink - up to 300Mbps</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Technology Used</h4>

<h5>MIMO</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Combines multiple antenna on both the transmitter (4G tower) and the receiver (smartphone)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>So a 2x2:2 MIMO means there are 2 antennas on the transmitter and 2 antennas on the receiver, transmitting and receiving 2 independent data streams</li>
	<li>Therefore, more antenna means faster potential speeds as data streams can travel more efficiently</li>
</ul>

<h5>Carrier Aggregation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Allows devices to receive multiple different 4G signals at once</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Signals do not have to be on same frequency, meaning one can receive an 1800MHz and 800MHz signal at the same time, which is not possible with standard 4G</li>
	<li>Up to 5 different signals can be combined at once with each offering 20MHz bandwidth, where they can be combined to create a data pipe of up to 100MHz of bandwidth</li>
</ul>

<h5>Relay Node</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Low power base stations that provide enhanced coverage and capacity at cell edge, and hot-spot areas and also be used to connect to remote areas without fibre connection</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>In networks with a mix of large and small cell, performance can be improve via introduction of Relay Nodes (RN)</li>
</ul>

<h3>5G</h3>

<h4>Aims for:</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Higher capacity than current 4G

		<ul>
			<li>Higher number of mobile broadband users per are unit</li>
			<li>Allow consumption of higher or unlimited data quantities in gigabyte per month</li>
			<li>Feasible for large portion of population to stream HD media many hours a day, when out of reach of WiFi hotspots</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Improve support of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit" title="Internet of ðŸ’©">Internet of Things</a>)</li>
	<li>Lower cost</li>
	<li>Lower battery consumption</li>
	<li>Lower latency than 4G equipment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Standards</h4>

<ul>
	<li>No current standards for 5G deployments</li>
	<li>Next Generation Mobile Network Alliance defines that a 5G standard should fulfil:

		<ul>
			<li>Data rates of 100Mbps for metropolitan areas</li>
			<li>1Gbps simultaneously to many workers on the same office floors</li>
			<li>Several hundred of thousands of simultaneous connections for massive wireless sensor network</li>
			<li>Spectral efficiency significantly enhanced compared to 4G</li>
			<li>Improve Coverage</li>
			<li>Signalling efficiency enhanced</li>
			<li>Latency reduced significantly compered to LTE</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
